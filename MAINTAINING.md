# Maintaining LadybugDB for .NET

This document is the durable maintainer guide for the `LadybugDB/ladybug-dotnet` repository. It replaces
the development-era working notes.

## Repository Shape

This repository contains the hand-written C# binding for the native Ladybug C API. It is also used as the
`tools/csharp_api` submodule inside the main `LadybugDB/ladybug` monorepo, where the engine source and
`src/include/c_api/lbug.h` are available at `../../`.

Main areas:

- `src/LadybugDB/` - managed API and P/Invoke interop.
- `test/LadybugDB.Tests/` - ABI guards and native round-trip tests.
- `cake/` - Cake Frosting build, test, native download, pack, and verification pipeline.
- `examples/` - runnable package-consumer examples.
- `lib/runtimes/<rid>/native/` - locally staged native libraries; gitignored.
- `artifacts/` - generated NuGet packages; gitignored.
- `download/` - cached upstream native release assets; gitignored.

## Versioning Policy

All packages in the family share one package version:

- `LadybugDB`
- `LadybugDB.Native`
- `LadybugDB.Native.win-x64`
- `LadybugDB.Native.linux-x64`
- `LadybugDB.Native.linux-arm64`
- `LadybugDB.Native.osx-x64`
- `LadybugDB.Native.osx-arm64`

The first three numeric segments track the native Ladybug engine release. The optional fourth numeric
segment is the .NET binding/package revision for binding-only releases over the same engine.

Examples:

- `0.17.0` - first stable .NET package family for engine `v0.17.0`.
- `0.17.0.1` - binding/package-only release that still uses engine `v0.17.0`.
- `0.17.0.2` - another binding/package-only release over engine `v0.17.0`.
- `0.17.1` - first package family for engine `v0.17.1`.
- `0.18.0-preview.1` - preview package family for a future engine `v0.18.0`.

`version.txt` is the default package-family version source. The build pipeline derives the native engine
tag from the first three numeric package-version segments unless explicitly overridden with
`--engine-version` or `ENGINE_VERSION`.

## Build, Test, Pack

From the repository root:

```powershell
dotnet build LadybugDB.slnx -c Release
dotnet test test/LadybugDB.Tests/LadybugDB.Tests.csproj -c Release
```

Native round-trip tests skip when no native library is staged. To require a native load, set:

```powershell
$env:LADYBUG_REQUIRE_NATIVE = '1'
dotnet test test/LadybugDB.Tests/LadybugDB.Tests.csproj -c Release
```

Use the Cake pipeline for package work:

```powershell
./build.ps1 --target Test
./build.ps1 --target Pack
```

On non-Windows shells:

```bash
./build.sh --target Test
./build.sh --target Pack
```

`Pack` downloads prebuilt native assets from `LadybugDB/ladybug` releases when they are not already staged
under `lib/runtimes/<rid>/native/`, then verifies package contents.

## Local Native Build

When this repository is checked out as `tools/csharp_api` in the main `LadybugDB/ladybug` monorepo, the
Windows helper can build the native shared library from the parent engine tree and run the full suite:

```powershell
pwsh -File scripts/build-native-and-test.ps1
```

Manual Windows recipe, from the main monorepo root with MSVC, CMake, and Ninja available:

```powershell
cmake -B build/release -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release `
  -DBUILD_SHELL=OFF -DBUILD_SINGLE_FILE_HEADER=OFF -DBUILD_STATIC_LBUG=OFF -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF `
  -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5 .
cmake --build build/release --target lbug_shared
Copy-Item build/release/src/lbug_shared.dll tools/csharp_api/lib/runtimes/win-x64/native/ -Force
dotnet test tools/csharp_api/test/LadybugDB.Tests/LadybugDB.Tests.csproj -c Release
```

PowerShell can mangle unquoted `-D` arguments; pass CMake flags as quoted strings or via an explicit
PowerShell array when scripting.

## Release Flow

1. Decide the package version and update `version.txt`.
2. Ensure the native engine release exists in `LadybugDB/ladybug` for the first three numeric package
   version segments, or pass `--engine-version` / workflow `engine_version`.
3. Run local validation where practical:

   ```powershell
   ./build.ps1 --target Test
   ./build.ps1 --target Pack
   ```

4. Merge through CI.
5. Tag the package version:

   ```bash
   git tag v0.17.0.1
   git push origin v0.17.0.1
   ```

The release workflow gates on linux-x64 against the real engine, packs the full package family, verifies
contents, and publishes all packages to NuGet through trusted publishing.

Manual `workflow_dispatch` builds and uploads artifacts without publishing. Use it for dry runs.

## ABI Update Checklist

The binding mirrors the C API in `LadybugDB/ladybug` exactly. ABI mistakes can compile cleanly and still
corrupt memory at runtime.

When moving to a new engine release:

1. Compare managed declarations against that release's `src/include/c_api/lbug.h`.
2. Update both interop declaration files:
   - `src/LadybugDB/Interop/Native.LibraryImport.cs`
   - `src/LadybugDB/Interop/Native.DllImport.cs`
3. Update structs/enums in `src/LadybugDB/Interop/NativeTypes.cs`.
4. Update or add ABI guard tests in `test/LadybugDB.Tests/StructLayoutTests.cs`.
5. Stage the matching native library and run the native round-trip tests.

Rules that should not change without deliberate review:

- Calling convention is Cdecl.
- C `bool` is one byte: use `byte` in structs and `[MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.U1)]` on bool returns.
- `lbug_system_config` includes the macOS-only trailing `thread_qos` field so the by-value struct layout
  matches across platforms.
- Native strings/blobs are copied to managed memory and then freed with the matching native destroy
  function.
- Result/tuple/value disposal must respect the native ownership flag.

## Package Family

`LadybugDB` is managed-only. Native libraries ship separately in one package per RID, and
`LadybugDB.Native` is a meta-package that depends on every per-RID native package. Consumers reference:

- `LadybugDB` plus `LadybugDB.Native` for all supported platforms, or
- `LadybugDB` plus one `LadybugDB.Native.<rid>` package for a slim single-platform app.

The shipped RIDs are `win-x64`, `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`, `osx-x64`, and `osx-arm64`.

### Optional satellite packages

Two additional managed packages share the family version but are published separately and carry their
own third-party dependencies, so the core package stays dependency-free:

- `LadybugDB.Extensions` — DI/health/resilience/streaming/export over `Microsoft.Extensions.*`.
- `LadybugDB.Arrow` — Apache Arrow interop over `Apache.Arrow`.

Both target `net10.0;netstandard2.0` like the core. `Pack` builds and verifies them alongside the
native family. **Before any `v*` release tag, the nuget.org trusted-publishing policy must be extended
to cover the `LadybugDB.Extensions` and `LadybugDB.Arrow` ids**, or their publish step fails.

### Source generator

The POCO mapping generator (`LadybugDB.SourceGen`, a `netstandard2.0` Roslyn analyzer) is shipped
**inside** the `LadybugDB` package under `analyzers/dotnet/cs/`. It emits the `LadybugRowMappers`
container and the `Map<T>`/`MapAsync<T>` extension methods into the consumer assembly only; the core
package deliberately ships no `LadybugRowMappers` type to avoid a cross-assembly type collision.

### Native loading on Unix

On Linux/macOS the resolver loads the engine with `dlopen(RTLD_NOW | RTLD_GLOBAL)` (see
`src/LadybugDB/Interop/UnixNativeMethods.cs`) so a dynamically loaded engine extension can resolve the
engine's symbols — matching what the Java/Node/Python/Rust bindings do. The path is marshalled as UTF-8.
The custom resolver is also wired for `netstandard2.0` (which has no `[ModuleInitializer]`). Do not
regress this without verifying engine-extension loading end-to-end on Linux.

## Examples

`examples/` contains:

- Core database-usage examples: `quickstart`, `demo-graph`, `prepared-statements`, `result-values`.
- Capability examples: `async` (Task/`IAsyncEnumerable`/cancellation), `engine-extensions`
  (`InstallExtension`/`LoadExtension`), `poco-mapping` (`[LadybugRow]` + `Map<T>`), `arrow`
  (`LadybugDB.Arrow` `RecordBatch` round-trip), and `di-extensions` (`LadybugDB.Extensions` DI, health
  check, resilience, and result export).
- `native-loading/`: deployment/package-loading example showing bundled native NuGet vs. system-installed
  native library behavior.

All examples consume published NuGet packages and share the example package version in
`examples/Directory.Build.props`. They are not part of CI because their package restore depends on a
published package version being available, so update that version when cutting a release and keep the
example code in sync with the public API.
